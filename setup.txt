Strengo is a workout logging app written in React Native.
It is emulated through Expo CLI for development.

Pre-requisites:
Visual Studio Code
Latest version of Node.JS

There are 3 ways of running the app:
1. Emulate onto iOS. Only available on macOS devices, required setting up emulation and Xcode (seperate guides).
2. Emulate onto Android. May require extra setup, available on any OS.
3. Running the app on an iOS/Android device through Expo Go
(4.) Running it on web. Not recommended, the app is not made for the web.

//Download the project and extract it if zipped
//Open cmd/terminal and navigate to ../Strengo-main/StrengoApp
//Run 'npm expo install'
//Open VSC and open a terminal
//Run 'npx expo run'
//If there is a message about outdated expo version, press CTRL + C to terminate session and follow the given instructions
  //Run again
//If not emulating, download Expo Go on a phone and scan QR
//If emulating, follow given menu

All work has mainly been done in /app and /services
